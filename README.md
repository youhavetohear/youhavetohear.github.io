## Installation

Add this to the `_config.yml`:

```yaml
remote_theme: youshouldlistentothis/theme
```

## Usage

The layouts available in this theme are:

- loop: for use on the main blog posts feed page
- post: for blog posts
- page: for any standard pages
- four-oh-four: for the 404 page
- default: which gives you the barebones page template

You can additionally insert into layouts or pages:

- analytics: for CloudFlare analytics â€” set up an ID in your `_config.yml`
- footer: to add a page footer
- header: to add a page header
- head: essential HTML `<head>` content
- skiplink: add a skip link if you need one

Any fonts in the assets folder are open sourced and licenses are in the respective folder.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `jekyll-theme.gemspec` accordingly.
