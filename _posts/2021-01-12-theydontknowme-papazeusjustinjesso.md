You want a hump day pick me up? Okay, it ain’t Wednesday, but weeks are long and harsh in 2021 and sometimes you just need that lift sooner! We doubt you’ll find a more satisfying one than this - **you have to hear** the explosive new dancefloor filler from Papa Zeus. 

Featuring the sultry vocal talents of Justin Jesso, this is one of those songs that is a sum of many great parts - from a funky bassline in the chorus, to piano chords that lift and build throughout the bridge, to a full on brass explosion that presents as our chorus - but is at its best in the last forty seconds when all of them combine. 

It’s a song that will absolutely transform your living room into a party paradise (imagine you’re somewhere with sun, you might as well) but if you read the lyrics stand-alone - you may not expect so. It’s effectively a 21st Century ‘Nothing Compares 2 U’ with Justin singing (sometimes in beautiful falsetto, sometimes the opposite, Zeus employing a deep vocoder effect) about how there’s no point trying with anyone else now he’s experienced a taste of the subject.

And that’s sort of how we feel about this song, we dare the dance singles of Future-2021 to be as catchy, as euphoric, as bold and as - well - brassy!

**For fans of:** Sigala, Sax (the song), Sax (the large golden object), pretending you’re at a beach club when you’re actually in the bath.
