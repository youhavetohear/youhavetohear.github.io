Do YOU like your guitar music led by a strong (but sweet) female vocal? Well do we have a treat for you! Today **you have to hear** an offering from the new Fickle Friends EP, _Weird Years Season One_ - a five song set that covers various tempos, textures and tastes!

This is one of the most straightforward moments, an indie-pop anthem that questions the intentions and thought processes of a far-off penpal. What Fickle Friends do **so** well is the juxtaposition of musical style with their lyrics - quite often tales of sadness and depression are set to upbeat, shimmering, knob-twiddling production, and here we have a big pop guitar moment soundtracking a story of deep frustration.

It will be a sound familiar to those already fans of the band - the clear honey vocals of lead singer Natassja make the band instantly recognisable as it is - set to instrumentation that puts us in the realm of The 1975 and the like.  For those who are less familiar, we canâ€™t urge you any more to check out the groups debut LP _You Are Someone Else_ which features bops such as this aplenty.

IRL could well be some kind of Covid anthem too, the lyrics (asking a potential partner if the process could be sped up and they could meet in real life) being rather relatable with regards the impatience of not just wanting to speak to somebody through a device (hey there, Zoom!). Something we have probably all been feeling over the last 12 months! 

**For fans of:** Pale Waves, songs high on the Coronavirus relatability scale, guitar tinged music with a heavy female presence
