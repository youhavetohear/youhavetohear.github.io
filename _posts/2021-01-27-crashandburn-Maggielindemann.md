If you haven’t heard from Maggie Lindemann since 2017’s _Pretty Girl_ then you may a) be surprised at the pop punk direction of this new release and b) have to concede that she was truth telling in the main refrain of that hit single. Back and hard hitting in 2020, **you have to hear** her rip roaring new single.

Evoking and packing the musical punch of mid noughties Paramore (the backing is _very ‘Misery Business’/‘Riot’_ era Hayley et al), this is two and a half minutes of pedal to the metal - from very literally second one this has a fury and an energy that never lets up, and various moments of great fast paced drum work in particular. 

Maggie’s vocals are fantastic, the verses (and bridge in particular) showcasing deep, angsty tones which is in contrast to the chorus where she belts out higher, more colourful and almost more desperate - as she begs the person who has walked away with not so much as an explanation to talk it out with her. 

Highlights include the lyric ‘you thought I was the killer.... you’re looking in the mirror’ and a ‘wooooooooah’ middle eight that was born for the purpose of a stadium full of fans singing it out - hopefully Maggie is on her way to that becoming reality.

**For fans of:** Chvrches, the Fueled By Ramen roster in 2008, songs that would make a belting addition to a spin class
