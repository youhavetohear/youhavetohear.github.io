We haven’t posted in a while, but this song compelled us to. Today **you have to hear** this jaunty offering from German-Canadian singer-songwriter bülow, packing more punch in 2 minutes 50 seconds than we’ve managed for the entirety of 2021.

Set over a pulsating bassline which has a sense of urgency from the first second, there’s a lovely juxtaposition between the pure, sweet vocal and the more angsty nature of the musical set up. Also a great contrast is how the bridge dips in pace, evoking a slower, dreamy, slightly trippy feel, breaking up the song (to positive effect) before the horse bolts the stable again for an upbeat almost dnb-lite chorus. ‘Romp’ isn’t a word that gets much of an outing nowadays, but a romp this certainly is. 

Heavy on harmonies, with a great use of vocal effects, this is a song which knows how to have peaks and troughs (not an ongoing horse pun, we promise). Despite starting at high intensity, it pares back at certain points and knows when to amp up to the next level to keep it exciting. 

It could appeal to fans of all kinds of artists, with pop and indie sensibilities as well as a drum heavy, dancy chorus. She could be the kind of artist that straddles all the boxes.

**For fans of** Maggie Lindemann, confidence anthems, mad as you like bedroom raves.
