‘Big’ is not just the title of the new Rita Ora and Imanbek collaboration, but also a descriptor of the sound. **You have to hear** this David Guetta assisted anthem, because it’s going to be the soundtrack of your post-Coronavirus dancefloors!

We know she’s been a little naughty of late, and some are not ready to reward that behaviour. But we are _weak_, we listened, and now we are in love with the whole _Bang_ EP, which - similarly to ‘Big’ _ is an apt title for a collection of songs that go all the way off. 

Dirty bass driven, this is the kind of anthem that you absolutely **must** strut to, wherever you are going, Imagine the world is your catwalk and put one foot in front of the other to this irresistible beat. We don’t care if you’re in the office, the doctors surgery or the street. The beat must be obeyed. 

It’s all just so sexy. It’s fashion. It’s sweaty. It’s hot. And we love it.

There’s not much variation in the melody of the verses, it all sits in pretty much the same place in Rita’s voice, so it’s a surprise it is so incredibly catchy and captivating, but it absolutely works. In fact the somewhat monotonous vibes of the verses may be the absolute best part. 

So go on. Grab a friend and be the ‘bad bitches coming in twos’ that Rita sings about. It’s your destiny. 

**For fans of:** Tiësto, strutting like you’re on the main stage of Drag Race, the sexy side of breaking the rules.
