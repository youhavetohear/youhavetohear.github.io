You might well know the name from the megahit _Bust Your Windows_ (though you should know that beyond that she has three flawless and varied records to her name) but **you have to hear** Jazmine Sullivan at her soul roots best with this offering from new EP _Heaux Tales_

One of the least risqué tracks on an EP that is largely about securing the bag and securing the D, this song is a big middle finger to a man who has wronged her one too many times and is fresh out of chances. Set to a sultry slow jam which is in no rush and has absolutely nowhere to be, Jazmine’s rich, deep tones have room to play and space to breathe. 

The runs are remarkable, the riffs insane (though these are no new feature in Sullivan’s work) and the build from the deep part of her range to the absolutely letting rip in the latter choruses is a joy to watch, even if she is telling you to pack up and get the fu*k out.

There are few people smoother or more soulful in the game and on this release she dedicates time to proving that, her live acoustic recording of it being honestly.. an even better and more powerful vocal. Top of the game stuff. 

**For fans of:** H.E.R, JoJo in her latest sexed up iteration, riffs and runs longer than the M6
