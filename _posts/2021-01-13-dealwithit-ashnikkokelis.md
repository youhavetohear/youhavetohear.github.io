Don’t be fooled by the opening bars of this song, as a xylophone-esque instrument leads us in with the sounds of what appears to be a nursery rhyme melody - this song is a **savage** attack on an ex lover and **you have to hear** the swipes Ashnikko takes on her new single with the help of the legendary Kelis.

There’s an explosive pop chorus at the centre that is it’s most straight forward moment but there is so much more depth and edge throughout, impeccably produced (from just really interesting, left-of-centre instrumentation choices, to a deeper ‘mirror’ vocal underneath Ashnikko’s own, to the use of a familiar buzzing sound that runs rampant(!) during one of the verses) and never, ever dull. And that’s before you’ve even got to the repeated sample of the Kelis classic ‘Caught Out There’ acting as an anchor throughout.

The lyricism is on point here, digs coming left right and centre (‘emotional maturity for dummies’) as well as some great revenge ideas (‘I put that teddy bear you gave me in a blender’) and in all it’s Pokemon Evolution ‘I’m on some next level shit now and I don’t need you’ glory it really is an exciting listen start to finish. Set to the backing of ‘I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW’ and the perfectly placed ‘AAAAAH’ (the worlds best known scream besides Wilhelm?) courtesy of Kelis, this is a ride that never lets up, and we love it.

Plus, what could be more relatable than the opening line ‘I don’t need a man, I need a puppy’? Lyrics to live by.

**For fans of**: Zara Larsson at her sassiest, calling out your ex and then destroying their lives, reinventing the CLASSICS
