This will be something funny, witty, insightful, maybe even Earth-shatteringly wise. It’ll be more than a tweet-sized entry, but not a novel. Probably the length of a paragraph; because paragraphs are cool. 

Maybe there’s even two paragraphs. I don’t know. It’s your blog. So write something already. Something about a song – that’s what this blog is for, after all! Chop, chop.
